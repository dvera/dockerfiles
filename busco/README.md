# BUSCO v2
Dockerized BUSCO v2

### what
This is a repo containing a Dockerfile for creating an ubuntu image with assembly QC tool [BUSCO v2](http://busco.ezlab.org/v2/). This Dockerfile can be built by users but is also used to create an automatically-built image on Docker hub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/vera/busco/).  

### usage
In order to run BUSCO using the image on Docker hub built from this Dockerfile, enter the directory containing your input fasta and your extracted lineage directory and run the docker image as follows, entering the BUSCO command-line arguments after `vera/busco`  (in this example, assumes your input fasta is called `a.fasta` and your lineage directory is called `tetrapoda_odb9` and your reference species is `chicken`):
 
```bash
docker run -d -v $(pwd):/data --name busco1 \
 vera/busco -i a.fasta -o buscotest1 -l tetrapoda_odb9 -m genome -c 24 -sp chicken
```

The docker container running BUSCO will output files in a directory `buscotest1` in the current directory. You can monitor the run by examining the log files generated by BUSCO, and by using the docker logs command with the name of the container specified with `--name` when creating the container:
```bash
docker logs -f busco1
```
